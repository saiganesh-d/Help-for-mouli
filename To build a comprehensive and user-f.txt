To build a comprehensive and user-friendly vulnerability management system with integrated threat intelligence, consider adding the following features and functionalities:

### 1. **Real-time Monitoring and Alerts**
   - **Real-time Updates**: Continuously update the system with the latest vulnerability and threat intelligence data.
   - **Alerting System**: Implement an alerting mechanism for high-risk vulnerabilities, emerging threats, and new exploits. Alerts can be sent via email, SMS, or integration with collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams.

### 2. **Risk Assessment and Scoring**
   - **Contextual Risk Scores**: Enhance risk scoring by considering factors such as exploit maturity, threat actor activity, asset criticality, and business impact.
   - **Prioritization**: Implement prioritization algorithms that help users focus on the most critical vulnerabilities first.

### 3. **Asset Management**
   - **Asset Inventory**: Maintain an inventory of assets, including software, hardware, and network components.
   - **Asset-Vulnerability Mapping**: Map vulnerabilities to specific assets to understand the potential impact on the organization’s infrastructure.

### 4. **Remediation Guidance**
   - **Fix Recommendations**: Provide detailed remediation guidance, including patches, configurations, and workaround suggestions.
   - **Patch Management Integration**: Integrate with patch management systems to automate the deployment of security updates.

### 5. **Threat Intelligence Integration**
   - **Enriched Data**: Integrate multiple threat intelligence feeds to enrich vulnerability data with IoCs, TTPs, and threat actor profiles.
   - **Incident Correlation**: Correlate vulnerabilities with recent incidents and breaches to provide context on how they are being exploited in the wild.

### 6. **Reporting and Dashboards**
   - **Customizable Dashboards**: Allow users to create customizable dashboards to visualize vulnerability metrics, trends, and risk posture.
   - **Comprehensive Reports**: Generate detailed reports for different stakeholders, including executive summaries, compliance reports, and technical details for security teams.

### 7. **Compliance Management**
   - **Compliance Mapping**: Map vulnerabilities and remediation actions to regulatory and industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and ISO 27001.
   - **Compliance Reporting**: Provide compliance-specific reports to help organizations meet regulatory requirements.

### 8. **Automation and Orchestration**
   - **Workflow Automation**: Automate common workflows such as vulnerability scanning, assessment, remediation, and reporting.
   - **Integration with SIEM and SOAR**: Integrate with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms for comprehensive threat detection and response.

### 9. **User Management and Access Control**
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to manage user permissions and ensure that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel.
   - **Audit Trails**: Maintain audit logs of all actions within the system to ensure accountability and traceability.

### 10. **Machine Learning and Predictive Analysis**
   - **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning to predict which vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited in the near future.
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns that may indicate emerging threats or vulnerabilities.

### 11. **User Education and Training**
   - **Security Awareness**: Include features for user education, such as training modules on vulnerability management and secure coding practices.
   - **Knowledge Base**: Provide a knowledge base with articles, tutorials, and best practices for vulnerability management and threat intelligence.

### 12. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - **API Integrations**: Provide APIs for integration with other security tools, such as endpoint protection, firewalls, and network monitoring systems.
   - **Plugin Support**: Develop plugins for popular platforms like Jira, ServiceNow, and Confluence to integrate vulnerability management workflows with existing tools.

### 13. **Mobile Accessibility**
   - **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile application or responsive web interface to allow users to access the system on the go.

### Example of Enhanced Risk Scoring with Contextual Factors

Here’s an enhanced version of the risk scoring function that includes additional contextual factors:

```python
def calculate_enhanced_risk_score(cve_details, exploits, otx_data, asset_criticality, business_impact):
    cvss_score = cve_details['impact']['baseMetricV3']['cvssV3']['baseScore']
    exploit_count = len(exploits)
    otx_pulse_count = len(otx_data.get('pulse_info', {}).get('pulses', []))
    asset_score = asset_criticality * 1.5  # Adjust weight as needed
    business_score = business_impact * 2   # Adjust weight as needed
    
    # Enhanced risk score calculation
    risk_score = (cvss_score + (exploit_count * 2) + (otx_pulse_count * 3) + asset_score + business_score) / 2
    return risk_score

# Example usage
asset_criticality = 8  # Scale 1-10
business_impact = 9    # Scale 1-10
risk_score = calculate_enhanced_risk_score(cve_details, exploits, otx_data, asset_criticality, business_impact)
print(f'Calculated Enhanced Risk Score: {risk_score}')
```

### Conclusion

By incorporating these features, your vulnerability management system will not only provide detailed vulnerability and threat intelligence data but also offer actionable insights and automation to improve the organization's overall security posture. This holistic approach will help users efficiently manage vulnerabilities and respond to threats, ensuring a robust security framework.
